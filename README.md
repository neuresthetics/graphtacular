This Graph has Vertices that have Kernels which are given Strands..

Strands passed into Kernels, which contain a reference to the Vertex that is inside.

Vertices have references to the matrix they are inside.

So a Kernel can operate in terms of all the Vertices in the graph it's in.

The Graph is structured like this:

```
 public class Graph
    {
        // registry
        public List<Vertex> AllVertices = new List<Vertex>();
        // registry count
        public int size = 0;
        // adjacency matrix
        public List<List<int>> Matrix = new List<List<int>>();
        // vertex-guid to matrix position translation
        public Dictionary<Guid, int> MatrixKey = new Dictionary<Guid, int>();
```

A Vertex looks something like this:

```
public class Vertex
    {
        public Guid ID = Guid.NewGuid();
        public BaseKernel K { get; set; }
        public Graph cluster { get; set; }

        public Vertex(BaseKernel k)
        {
            K = k;
        }
    }
```

A Vertex has a Kernel object which gives it the ability to execute functions on itself.

A Strand is a series of instructions, in this case, the seed vertex is given the entire strand, which generates a linked list with a blob on the end:

```
public void Flower()
        {
            int n = 1;
            // flowers
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KbranchUndirected", 1, 1 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KbranchUndirected", 1, 1 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KbranchUndirected", 1, 1 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KbranchUndirected", 1, 1 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KbranchUndirected", 1, 1 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KbranchUndirected", 1, 1 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KbranchUndirected", 1, 1 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KbranchUndirected", 1, 1 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { "KcompleteCluster", 4, 7 }); n++;
            flower.Add(n, new object[] { null });
        }
```

The strand is passed to the Kernel, which parses it and calls logic on its shell Vertex:

```
switch (ss[0])
            {
                case "KbranchUndirected":
                    KbranchUndirected(strand, step, Convert.ToInt32(ss[1]), Convert.ToInt32(ss[2]));
                    break;

                case "KcompleteCluster":
                    KcompleteCluster(strand, step, Convert.ToInt32(ss[1]), Convert.ToInt32(ss[2]));
                    break;

                default:
                    break;
            }
```

Kernels are used to generate pre-programmed motifs. The above strand passed to a single seed Vertex produces the following matrix and graph:

## GEXF - save graph to file
You can view saved [graphs](https://github.com/jasonb315/graphtacular/tree/master/Graphtacular/Graphtacular/Saves) which are exported as [GEXF](https://github.com/neuresthetics/graphtacular/blob/master/Graphtacular/Graphtacular/Classes/Gexf.cs) (Graph Exchange XML Format) for display in [Gephi](https://gephi.org/)

### Building clusters from the outside:

Operations on sets of Vertices in clumps from the outside tend to produce more geological or crystal shapes.

This is a logarithmic cluster with edges reflecting the repetitive global split

Does it feel kind of like ice, inorganic?

### Driving clusters from the inside:

Fibonacci:

look feel has more body, more life?

The big round one has a look and feel of a wrinkly brain given its modular shape scrunched into space.

big O time and space does not include dependent functions, such as NondirectionalClusteringCoefficient simply:

```
both of which have their own runtime complexity..
